                                    Serotonin, also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a monoamine 
                                    neurotransmitter. It also acts as a hormone.As a neurotransmitter, 
                                    serotonin carries messages between nerve cells in your brain (your central nervous system) 
                                    and throughout your body (your peripheral nervous system). 
                                    <br><br>
                                    These chemical messages tell your body how to work.
                                    Serotonin plays several roles in your 
                                    body, including influencing learning, memory, happiness as well as 
                                    regulating body temperature, sleep, sexual behavior and hunger. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Lack of enough serotonin is thought to play a role in depression, anxiety, mania 
                                    and other health conditions.Most of the serotonin found in your body 
                                    is in your gut (intestines). About 90% of serotonin is found in the
                                    cells lining your gastrointestinal tract. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    It’s released into your blood circulation and absorbed 
                                    by platelets. Only about 10% is produced in your brain.
                                    Serotonin is made from the essential 
                                    amino acid tryptophan. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    An essential amino acid means it can’t 
                                    be made by your body. It has to be obtained from the foods you eat.

                                    Serotonin plays a role in many of your body’s functions:
                                    Mood: Serotonin in your brain regulates your mood. It’s often called your 
                                    body’s natural “feel good” chemical. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    When serotonin is at normal levels, 
                                    you feel more focused, emotionally stable, happier and calmer. Low levels 
                                    of serotonin are associated with depression.

                                    Many medications used to treat 
                                    anxiety, depression and other mood disorders often target ways to increase 
                                    the level of serotonin in your brain.

                                                Your gut can increase serotonin release to speed digestion to rid your body 
                                                of irritating foods or toxic products. Serotonin also plays a part in reducing
